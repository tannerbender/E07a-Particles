# E07a-Particles
Playing with particles and emitters

Within this file we are playing around with some particles and some png sprites that we can change around to get a different look. We can change the parameters of the global settings to change the velocity, max, min, etc of the particles. When you run the file you can see that when you hold your mouse it will show the particles that have been chosen until the user releases the mouse.
